<abbr title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN&trade;</abbr> (<strong>X</strong>HTML <strong>F</strong>riends <strong>N</strong>etwork) is a simple way to represent human relationships using hyperlinks.  In recent years, <dfn><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.technorati.com/help/blogging101.html\n\nThis file was not retrieved because it was filtered out by your project settings.\n\nWould you like to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.technorati.com/help/blogging101.html'" title="Hyperlink to a definition of the term 'blog' and related terms.">blogs</a></dfn> and <dfn><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.microcontentnews.com/resources/glossary/blogrolling.htm\n\nThis file was not retrieved because it was filtered out by your project settings.\n\nWould you like to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.microcontentnews.com/resources/glossary/blogrolling.htm'" title="Hyperlink to a definition of the term 'blogrolling'">blogrolls</a></dfn> have become the fastest growing area of the Web.  XFN enables web authors to indicate their relationship(s) to the people in their blogrolls simply by adding a '<code>rel</code>' attribute to their <code title="hyperlink anchor">&lt;a href&gt;</code> tags, e.g.:
</p>
<p>
<code class="eg">&lt;a href="http://jeff.example.org" <strong>rel="friend met"</strong>&gt;...</code>
